New project phase, I need to create new workspace to work with from another stream of Accurev (Accurev is a proprietary SCM my client's used). Unfortunately, the first phase i didn't configure the workspace myself (I already got the system configured in this Thinkpad I've got from my client).

Started with get new stream into my local workspace from Accurev. I thought it wil easy, because I knew how to do it. The problem is the stream is way too big. To download the stream takes about 6 hours and it's not the only problem. The download failed several times and I have to redo everything. It took more than 5 days to do this. The hashtag is #AccurevS*ck

Eventually, I've managed to download the stream to local workspaces. Yay.. I celebrated that myself. And then next step to deal with. The RAD workspace configuration. (Playing horror music)

I open my client organization's wiki, the one that have been written by everyone who is member of organization, especially developers and architects. There were many wiki posts that seemed will explain how to establish new workspace. But then I realized many of them are old posts.

Argh... And I still trying blindly right now.
