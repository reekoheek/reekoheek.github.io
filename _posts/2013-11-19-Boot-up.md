Recently, I've been working at project for big international client. It's an iPad application for their customers. I've had learned a lot about how small mistake in architectural decision could affect much for the development process. In this experiences, I found that many developers frustrated and even put their head at stake for this application.

Gladly for me, I have many experiences to learn about. Good architecture, bad architecture, new programming language (yeah, I've made myself expert at iOS application with Objective-C today), designing, and experiencing the USA work of field. Later post, I will share in this blog about this experiences. 

In my spare times, I also working at my internal projects to build product. This is my sandbox playground to mix the latest technology I've known to make something. Cant wait to share here about it.
