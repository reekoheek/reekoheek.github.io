This is my first post. This blog is intended to journalize my research activity on bleeding edge technology. Recently, likely, it will be filled by several topics like programming such as Node.js, PHP, Java, etc, but it doesn't close the opportunity window to another topics.

There's no intention to flame on several hot topics but my intention to make the journal as open as possible to be widely accessed to me from anywhere and anytime using any means to reach the web.

So... let's start our journey..
